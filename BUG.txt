Part 4
The vulnerability that exists is that the useCard file doesn’t check to make sure the card number being provided belongs to the user that’s currently logged in.
The put call currently passes the card number and the token belonging to the logged in user.
The backend server does not check to make sure the token corresponds to the user that the card belongs to.

The way to resolve this would be to conduct a simple check to ensure the card number being passed in belongs to the user that’s logged in.
