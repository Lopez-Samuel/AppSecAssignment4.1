Part 2
1.The two types of intents are explicit intents and implicit intents.
2. The explicit intent is more secure because you are directly telling the application which component to use. The implicit intent uses keywords to figure out what component to use.
3. In second fragment we see an implicit intent.
4. In third fragment we see an explicit intent. 
5. The proper way to do an intent is shown in third fragment since it is an explicit intent.

The intent that needed fixing was the one in second fragment. To do this I sent the register view to the product scrolling view with the below lines of code.

var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)
intent.putExtra("User", loggedInUser);
startActivity(intent)
